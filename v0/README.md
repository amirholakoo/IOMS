   **User Authentication & Roles**:
    
    *   Since you want users to log in with their phone number and receive a password, we could add multi-factor authentication for extra security. For example, sending a verification code to their phone.
        
    *   Different user roles could be created: an admin who approves users, and regular users who can fill out forms.
        
   **Admin Panel**:
    
    *   The admin panel can have a dashboard showing all pending user registrations, allowing you to approve or reject them.
        
    *   You could also have a section to update daily prices for cash or terms, which would automatically update on the user side.
        
   **Form Submission and Notifications**:
    
    *   When a user submits a form, the system can send an automatic notification (email or SMS) to you or the relevant department for processing.
        
   **Data Management and Analytics**:
    
    *   Over time, you can add features to generate reports from the data collected in the PostgreSQL database. This could be really useful for tracking trends or customer behavior.
        
   **Security and Privacy**:
    
    *   Since you'll be handling user data (like phone numbers), we should implement secure connections (HTTPS) and ensure data privacy. We can also think about GDPR compliance if needed.
        
*   **User Experience**:
    
    *   We could add a friendly user interface with a simple design that makes it easy for customers to navigate.
        
    *   Maybe add an FAQ section or a chatbot for common questions.
        
   **Scalability**:
    
    *   In the future, if you want to handle more traffic or more complex operations, we can think about using cloud hosting or load balancing to keep the system running smoothly.
