   - `run_tests.py` - Unified test runner supporting both pytest and unittest

2. **Test Files Structure**
   ```
   tests/
   ├── test_basic.py           # 3 tests - Basic system validation
   ├── test_user_creation.py   # 32 tests - User management & creation
   ├── test_user_purchase.py   # 25 tests - Purchase workflow
   ├── test_permissions.py     # 35 tests - Security & access control
   └── test_payments.py        # 40 tests - Payment processing
   ```

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Mock payment gateways (ZarinPal, Shaparak)
